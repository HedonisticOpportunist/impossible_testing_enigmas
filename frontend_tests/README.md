# UI Tests ₍^. .^₎⟆

## How to Run

You can run the tests in the following manner:

- Ensure you have _Cypress_ installed.
- Navigate into the **UITests** folders using the `cd` command.
- Run the `npx cypress run -- headless` command.

For other commands, please see the Cypress [documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/app/get-started/install-cypress).

## Why Cypress?

Cypress was chosen for its ease of installation, which was an important factor given the timeboxing constraints of this exercise.
